## What's in **Reference**

### API reference

s2n-tls uses [Doxygen](https://doxygen.nl/index.html) to document its public API. The latest s2n-tls documentation can be found on [GitHub pages](https://aws.github.io/s2n-tls/doxygen/).

Documentation for older versions or branches of s2n-tls can be generated locally. To generate the documentation, install doxygen and run `doxygen docs/doxygen/Doxyfile`. The doxygen documentation can now be found at `docs/doxygen/output/html/index.html`.

Doxygen installation instructions are available at the [Doxygen](https://doxygen.nl/download.html) webpage.
